The code begins by importing necessary libraries for data handling, visualization, and machine learning. It then loads the dataset into a DataFrame and prints basic information about it. Visualization is performed through distribution plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data. Missing values are handled using imputation, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Features are scaled for improved model performance. A RandomForestRegressor,GradientBoostingRegressor and others model is trained and used to make predictions. Finally, the model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error and RÂ² score, and the predictions are compared with actual values.
